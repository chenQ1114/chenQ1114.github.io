I joined School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology as a lecturer in Sept. 2020. I received the B.Eng. degree and PhD degree in computer science from 
China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhihua Cai](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/caizhihua/en/index/22178/list/index.htm). I also collaborate
with [Anders Soeggard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/), [Desmond Elliott](https://elliottd.github.io/index.html) in DIKU, University of Copenhagen closely.

My research interests include question answering and multilingual multimodal representation learning.
